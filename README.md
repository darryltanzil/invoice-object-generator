# My Personal Project

## What will the Application do?
The application will be an invoice generator which takes in
time entry as input from the user, and outputs an invoice,
printable in *PDF* form. The core functionality will allow them to edit the data,
which will be *JSON* represented in a *GUI* format. The user will then be able to export
as a *PDF* afterwards.

## Who will use it?
**Contractors** can use this application, giving them an easy
way to keep track of their finances. As well as this, **small businesses, accountants,
and anyone looking for an easy way to generate their invoices** will be able to use it
as well. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
As a tech contractor myself, I struggle a lot with keeping
my invoices in check; my current workflow includes using
an invoice generator online. Although it works, it is
clunky, and I sometimes become disorganized, and end up
wasting time. I hope that a desktop application will allow
contractors to allow greater organization, both for myself, 
and others.
